        <h1>About me</h1>
    <p1> Hello everyone, my name is Becca Lilland, I am fascinated with everything about technology, I want to learn more about this, and that is why I am so excited to take this class. I am a very outgoing person who likes to have fun and meet new people.I love hiking, the walking to the top, may be a little hard, I know, but when you get to the top the view is always worth it, and I hope by the time I finish this class all the work I put in would have paid of.
        </p1>
